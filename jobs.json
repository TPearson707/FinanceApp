Our developer-first, data-driven approach enables companies to automate their billing processes and adapt their pricing strategies with ease.</p><p></p><p>With Orb, revenue workflows are seamless for every team: developers love our intuitive API and extensibility, product managers iterate on pricing and packaging faster, finance teams gain fine-grained reporting for revenue recognition, and customer-facing teams build trust through billing transparency. Companies like Vercel, Pinecone, and Replit rely on Orb to power their most critical revenue initiatives.</p><p></p><p>Backed by $44.1 million in funding from top investors like Mayfield, Menlo Ventures, and Greylock, we\u2019re building a hybrid, in-office culture in downtown San Francisco (3 days/week).

These data pipelines need to be incredibly robust; the accuracy of every event counts.</p></li><li><p>Understand how to scale query throughput against our specialized datastores in service of product features like real-time alerting while maintaining maximum flexibility in metrics customers can define. This allows our customers to implement usage limits and spend management through Orb.</p></li><li><p>Provide the most performant and flexible APIs to our customers and their end users, so they can build experiences that leverage usage data stored in Orb.</p></li><li><p>Build simple and reusable system-level components to serve as a foundation for other engineers.

Not only does this allow you to make the most efficient use of your space and resources, it frees up your team\u2019s time to focus on the work that matters. </span></p>\n<p><span>With Envoy\u2019s intuitive technology that employees actually enjoy using, you can create a great workplace experience that fosters community and togetherness by making it easy for teams to coordinate working onsite. </span></p>\n<p><span>Unlike companies that offer disconnected workplace solutions and disparate (and often imprecise) data sources, Envoy\u2019s platform provides accurate, comprehensive, and unified workplace data so you can make informed business decisions.

Just as servers work together to scale compute in web2, so too can rollups scale onchain compute in web3. But building and operating your own rollup is difficult and time-consuming. That's where Conduit comes in.</p><p>As the rollup-native cloud platform, Conduit combines web2 engineering best-practices with web3 rollup technology to make it easy for anyone to launch and maintain their own chain. By making infrastructure simple and onchain compute abundant, similar to how AWS and GCP did for web2, we can unlock the next wave of innovation in the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>The Conduit platform has seen massive growth since going live in 2023. We <a href=\"https://rollup.wtf/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">run the largest chains</a> in production, including Proof of Play, Zora, Aevo, and <a href=\"https://www.conduit.xyz/customers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">more</a>. This translates to 200+ chains across mainnet and testnet and over $1B in total-value-locked (TVL). We're operating on the bleeding edge of crypto, co-evolving with our customers and integration partners, and pushing the limits of blockchain scalability and modularity.</p><p>This success has been recognized and accelerated through a <a href=\"https://blog.conduit.xyz/conduit-series-a/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$37M Series A</a>, co-led by Paradigm and Haun Ventures \u2014 two of the best investors in the industry.</p><p>We\u2019re an elite team that\u2019s previously worked at Meta, Brex, Wish, Compound, Chainalysis, Immunefi, Amazon, Avara/Aave, Paradigm, and more. We\u2019re headquartered in San Francisco, with team members all over the world.</p><p>We\u2019re looking for ambitious, talented builders that want to help scale Ethereum and bring crypto compute to the masses. Join us!</p><p></p><p><strong>About the Role</strong></p><p>In this role you'll be working closely with the CEO to develop, maintain, and the rollup stack offerings and customizations made possible by our leading Rollup-as-a-Service platform. You\u2019ll develop custom precompiles and whitelisted contract deployers that create entirely new or more efficient functionality, as well as help us expand our support for emerging L2s. We value people who can quickly obtain a deep technical understanding, are able to quickly create proof-of-concepts to validate entirely new approaches, and enjoy being self-directed and identifying the most important problems to solve.</p><p><strong>As a Software Engineer, Rollup Product you should:</strong></p><ul><li><p>A strong background in distributed systems, cryptography, and network protocols.</p></li><li><p>Have some experience hacking on the various rollups, understand the underlying components, and have opinions about the various trade-offs of those components and platforms.</p></li><li><p>Have some experience with hacking on EVM node software.</p></li><li><p>Have a deep understanding of the EVM and how external tooling integrates with it.</p></li><li><p>Familiarity with multiple programming languages, including but not limited to Golang, Rust, and Solidity.</p></li><li><p>Contribute to defining Conduit\u2019s product strategy and roadmap with the rest of the team.</p></li></ul><p><strong>We think you\u2019ll find this work really exciting if you:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Love rollups and their potential to exponentially scale Ethereum, and are excited about building best-in-class tooling and infrastructure for it and around it.</p></li><li><p>You\u2019re excited to architect, build, and deploy the systems, services, and integrations that help our rollups connect with other ecosystem partners.</p></li><li><p>Have experience tinkering with optimistic and ZK rollups and deploying applications to the various chains.</p></li><li><p>Can debug problems across the stack, such as networking issues, performance problems, or memory leaks</p></li><li><p>Own problems end-to-end, and are willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done</p></li></ul><p><strong>Our tech stack</strong></p><p>Our infrastructure is built on Kubernetes, Postgres, and Cloud Tasks on GCP, and the products on top utilize a mix of React, Javascript/Typescript, Go, Rust, and Postgres.

Just as servers work together to scale compute in web2, so too can rollups scale onchain compute in web3. But building and operating your own rollup is difficult and time-consuming. That's where Conduit comes in.</p><p>As the rollup-native cloud platform, Conduit combines web2 engineering best-practices with web3 rollup technology to make it easy for anyone to launch and maintain their own chain. By making infrastructure simple and onchain compute abundant, similar to how AWS and GCP did for web2, we can unlock the next wave of innovation in the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>The Conduit platform has seen massive growth since going live in 2023. We <a href=\"https://rollup.wtf/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">run the largest chains</a> in production, including Proof of Play, Zora, Aevo, and <a href=\"https://www.conduit.xyz/customers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">more</a>. This translates to 200+ chains across mainnet and testnet and over $1B in total-value-locked (TVL). We're operating on the bleeding edge of crypto, co-evolving with our customers and integration partners, and pushing the limits of blockchain scalability and modularity.</p><p>This success has been recognized and accelerated through a <a href=\"https://blog.conduit.xyz/conduit-series-a/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$37M Series A</a>, co-led by Paradigm and Haun Ventures \u2014 two of the best investors in the industry.</p><p>We\u2019re an elite team that\u2019s previously worked at Meta, Brex, Wish, Compound, Chainalysis, Immunefi, Amazon, Avara/Aave, Paradigm, and more. We\u2019re headquartered in San Francisco, with team members all over the world.</p><p>We\u2019re looking for ambitious, talented builders that want to help scale Ethereum and bring crypto compute to the masses. Join us!</p><p></p><p><strong>About the Role</strong></p><p>In this role you'll be working closely with the CEO to develop, maintain, and the rollup stack offerings and customizations made possible by our leading Rollup-as-a-Service platform. You\u2019ll develop custom precompiles and whitelisted contract deployers that create entirely new or more efficient functionality, as well as help us expand our support for emerging L2s. We value people who can quickly obtain a deep technical understanding, are able to quickly create proof-of-concepts to validate entirely new approaches, and enjoy being self-directed and identifying the most important problems to solve.</p><p><strong>As a Software Engineer, Rollup Product you should:</strong></p><ul><li><p>A strong background in distributed systems, cryptography, and network protocols.</p></li><li><p>Have some experience hacking on the various rollups, understand the underlying components, and have opinions about the various trade-offs of those components and platforms.</p></li><li><p>Have some experience with hacking on EVM node software.</p></li><li><p>Have a deep understanding of the EVM and how external tooling integrates with it.</p></li><li><p>Familiarity with multiple programming languages, including but not limited to Golang, Rust, and Solidity.</p></li><li><p>Contribute to defining Conduit\u2019s product strategy and roadmap with the rest of the team.</p></li></ul><p><strong>We think you\u2019ll find this work really exciting if you:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Love rollups and their potential to exponentially scale Ethereum, and are excited about building best-in-class tooling and infrastructure for it and around it.</p></li><li><p>You\u2019re excited to architect, build, and deploy the systems, services, and integrations that help our rollups connect with other ecosystem partners.</p></li><li><p>Have experience tinkering with optimistic and ZK rollups and deploying applications to the various chains.</p></li><li><p>Can debug problems across the stack, such as networking issues, performance problems, or memory leaks</p></li><li><p>Own problems end-to-end, and are willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done</p></li></ul><p><strong>Our tech stack</strong></p><p>Our infrastructure is built on Kubernetes, Postgres, and Cloud Tasks on GCP, and the products on top utilize a mix of React, Javascript/Typescript, Go, Rust, and Postgres. While we value experience with these technologies, we are primarily looking for engineers with strong technical skills and the ability to quickly pick up new tools and frameworks.</p><p></p><h3>Conduit does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, non-disqualifying physical or mental disability, national origin, veteran status or any other basis covered by appropriate law.</h3>",

We are inventing a new way for developers to work with data and share it responsibly via data product containers.</span><span>Our vision is to build a world where AI/ML and analytics are powered by decentralized, responsible, and equitable data ownership, across boundaries of organizations, technology, and most importantly boundaries of trust.</span><span>Our purpose is to change the experience of creating, sharing, discovering, and using data forever, to be connected, fast, and fair based on data mesh principles.</span><span>Our technology is designed to empower data developers, users and owners with a delightful experience where data products are a first-class primitive, with trust built-in.</span><span>We are here to accept the reality that the world of data is complex and messy; data models are out-of-date the moment they are created; data is owned across trust boundaries; data is stored on different platforms; data is used in many different modes and most importantly data can't protect itself. We recognize that past approaches to tackle these complexities with centralized data collection, modeling and governance are ineffective at best and pathologically unfair at worst. Our mission is to reimagine the world of data with you.</span><br/><span>About The Role</span><span>As a</span><b> Founding Principal Software Engineer</b><span>, you will help build out the next generation data platform to support decentralized analytical and ML workloads, which includes data product containers and the data product container runtime. Given that we are still in the early stages (or foundational stages), your work will shape the future of how data mesh will get adopted by the industry.</span><span>You will apply your knowledge of having built large scale distributed systems and databases to build a new and secure OS platform for the data product developers of the future. You will contribute to the overall Nextdata OS design and own the design and implementation of significant parts of the OS.\u00a0</span><br/><span>You Are The Right Fit If You Have</span><span>- 10+ years working on large scale production-grade distributed systems, databases, data infrastructure, or big data management</span><span>- A working understanding of Kubernetes and at least one of the public clouds</span><span>- 8+ years experience working with Rust</span><span>- Experience with DevOps / CD\u00a0Experience building SaaS/PaaS products and contributing to big data / analytics OSS projects or internal data infra products\u00a0Experience working in digital-native scale-up data teams or startups</span><span>- Curiosity, passion and some experience in application of data in ML and Analytics applications\u00a0An understanding and experience with data mesh (if you don\u2019t have experience, the creator can help you get up to speed)The ability to effectively contribute to code / build self-directed and in the team</span><span>- Experience in design and architecture as well as delivery</span><span>- Experience working with a team of product, design, and engineering who review each other\u2019s work, holding each other to an extremely high standard</span><span>- You are an execution-oriented, product-minded technologist with high empathy for developers.
